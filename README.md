# Candy Dungeon Music Forge (CDMF) - macOS Edition

Candy Dungeon Music Forge (CDMF) is a **local-first AI music workstation for macOS**. It runs on your Mac, uses Apple Metal (MPS) GPU acceleration, and keeps your prompts and audio on your hardware. CDMF is powered by **ACE-Step** (text → music diffusion) and includes a custom UI for generating tracks, managing a library, and training **LoRAs**.

This fork is optimized for macOS with Apple Metal support, designed for both Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel Macs.

Status: **v0.1-macos**

## What you can do

- Generate music from a **prompt** (optionally with **lyrics**)
- Use a built-in **Music Player + library view** (sort, favorite, categorize)
- Save and reuse **presets**
- (Optional) **Stem separation** to rebalance vocals vs instrumentals
- Train **ACE-Step LoRAs** from your own datasets
- Dataset helpers:
  - Mass-create `_prompt.txt` / `_lyrics.txt` files
  - (Optional) Auto-tag datasets using **MuFun-ACEStep** (experimental)

## System requirements

### Minimum

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel Mac with AMD GPU
- 16 GB unified memory (for Apple Silicon) or 16 GB RAM
- ~10–12 GB VRAM/unified memory (more = more headroom)
- SSD with tens of GB free (models + audio + datasets)
- Python 3.10 or later

### Recommended

- Apple Silicon M1 Pro/Max/Ultra, M2 Pro/Max/Ultra, or M3 Pro/Max
- 32 GB+ unified memory
- Fast SSD
- Comfort reading terminal logs when something goes wrong

**Note:** Apple Metal (MPS) support enables GPU acceleration on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs with compatible AMD GPUs. Performance is optimized for Apple Silicon with unified memory architecture.

## Install and run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed:
```bash
# Check Python version
python3 --version

# If not installed, install via Homebrew
brew install python@3.10
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/audiohacking/CDMF-Fork.git
   cd CDMF-Fork
   ```

2. Make the launcher script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x CDMF.sh
   ```

3. Run the launcher:
   ```bash
   ./CDMF.sh
   ```

4. On first run, the script will:
   - Create a Python virtual environment (`venv_ace`)
   - Install packages from `requirements_ace_macos.txt`
   - Download ACE-Step and related models as needed
   - Install helpers like `audio-separator`
   - Open the UI in your default browser

The terminal window must remain open while CDMF is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.

### First launch notes

On first run, CDMF does real setup work:
- Creates a Python virtual environment (e.g. `venv_ace`)
- Installs packages from `requirements_ace.txt`
- Downloads ACE-Step and related models as needed
- Installs helpers like `audio-separator`

A console window (“server console”) appears and **must stay open** while CDMF runs. CDMF will open a loading page in your browser and then load the full UI when ready.

## Using CDMF (high-level workflow)

1. Launch CDMF and wait for the UI
2. Go to **Generate** → create tracks from prompt (and lyrics if desired)
3. Browse/manage tracks in **Music Player**
4. (Optional) Use stem controls to adjust vocal/instrumental balance
5. (Optional) Build a dataset and train a LoRA in **Training**

## Generation basics

- **Prompt**: your main ACE-Step tags / description (genre, instruments, mood, context)
- **Instrumental** mode:
  - Lyrics are not used
  - CDMF uses the `[inst]` token so ACE-Step focuses on backing tracks
- **Vocal** mode:
  - Provide lyrics using markers like `[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[solo]`, etc.
- **Presets** let you save/load a whole “knob bundle” (text + sliders)

## Stem separation (vocals vs instrumentals)

CDMF can run `audio-separator` as a post-process step so you can rebalance:
- Vocals level (dB)
- Instrumental level (dB)

First use requires downloading a **large** stem model and adds a heavy processing step. For fast iteration: generate with both gains at `0 dB`, then only use stems once you like a track.

## LoRA training

Switch to the **Training** tab to configure and start LoRA runs.

### Dataset structure

Datasets must live under:

`<CDMF root>\training_datasets`

For each audio file (`foo.mp3` or `foo.wav`), provide:
- `foo_prompt.txt` — ACE-Step prompt/tags for that track
- `foo_lyrics.txt` — lyrics, or `[inst]` for instrumentals

CDMF includes tools to bulk-create these files (and optionally auto-generate them with MuFun-ACEStep).

### Training parameters (examples)

- Adapter name (experiment name)
- LoRA config preset (JSON from `training_config`)
- Epochs / max steps
- Learning rate (commonly `1e-4` to `1e-5`)
- Max clip seconds (lower can reduce VRAM and speed up training)
- Optional SSL loss weighting (set to 0 for some instrumental datasets)
- Checkpoint/save cadence

## Experimental: MuFun-ACEStep dataset analyzer

MuFun-ACEStep can auto-generate `_prompt.txt` and `_lyrics.txt` files from audio. It’s powerful but:
- The model is large (tens of GB)
- Outputs aren’t perfect—skim and correct weird tags/lyrics before training

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **First launch takes forever**: Check terminal for pip/model download errors; verify disk space and network
- **No .wav files found**: Generate a track; confirm Output Directory matches the Music Player folder
- **Memory issues**: 
  - Reduce target length during generation
  - Reduce max clip seconds during training
  - Lower batch/grad accumulation if you changed them

### macOS-Specific

- **MPS (Metal) backend errors**: 
  - Ensure you're running macOS 12.0+ for MPS support
  - Some operations may fall back to CPU if not yet supported on MPS
  - Try setting `ACE_PIPELINE_DTYPE=float32` environment variable if you encounter precision issues:
    ```bash
    export ACE_PIPELINE_DTYPE=float32
    ./CDMF.sh
    ```

- **Python version issues**:
  ```bash
  # Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later
  python3 --version
  
  # Install via Homebrew if needed
  brew install python@3.10
  ```

- **Permission denied when running CDMF.sh**:
  ```bash
  chmod +x CDMF.sh
  ```

- **Browser doesn't open automatically**: 
  - Manually navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5056/` in your browser
  - Check if the terminal shows any error messages

- **Virtual environment issues**:
  ```bash
  # Remove existing venv and recreate
  rm -rf venv_ace
  ./CDMF.sh
  ```

## Performance Tips for Apple Silicon

- **Unified memory management**: Apple Silicon Macs with unified memory can efficiently share memory between CPU and GPU
- **Batch sizes**: Start with smaller batch sizes and gradually increase to find optimal performance
- **Model precision**: The pipeline automatically selects appropriate precision for MPS (float32 instead of bfloat16)
- **Generation length**: Longer generation times may require more memory; start with shorter durations and scale up

## About This Fork

This is a **macOS-optimized fork** of Candy Dungeon Music Forge, specifically designed for Apple Metal (MPS) GPU acceleration. This fork focuses exclusively on macOS support and does not maintain Windows compatibility.

### Differences from Original

- **Apple Metal (MPS) GPU support**: Optimized for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs with AMD GPUs
- **Device-agnostic code**: Automatic device selection (MPS → CPU fallback)
- **macOS launcher**: Native bash script (`CDMF.sh`) instead of Windows batch file
- **Unified memory optimizations**: Leverages Apple Silicon's unified memory architecture
- **macOS-specific dependencies**: Windows-specific packages removed

### Porting Updates from Upstream

To port updates from the original Windows version:

1. The original Windows requirements are preserved in `requirements_ace_windows_reference.txt`
2. The original Windows launcher is in `CDMF.bat`
3. When merging updates, focus on:
   - Core model and pipeline logic
   - UI and generation features
   - Dataset and training functionality
4. Adapt any Windows-specific or CUDA-only code to be device-agnostic
5. Test thoroughly with MPS backend

Key files for cross-platform compatibility:
- `cdmf_pipeline_ace_step.py` - Device selection and memory management
- `cdmf_trainer.py` - Training with device-agnostic autocast
- `music_forge_ui.py` - Browser opening logic
